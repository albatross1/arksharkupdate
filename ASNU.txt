I've updated the Discord, the previous Discord is still there but the join/invite no longer works, in this update the button now works as it will direct you to the new "arkshark.club" URL.

Look under the "Update(s)" tab in this program, then at the bottom click the "Push to visit the Discord" button.

From there, once you've joined back to the discord, make sure if you donated before simply PM me, I will then see our prev. disscussions an update your account in the Discord.`n`nAgain please be patient as I get everything back up again. Everything and everyone was removed and banned, I've unbanned everyone, but unable to reach out to you as our convo. history were cleared. Once you reach out to me I will see our history again.

Update! 5/6

Version 0.2600 has landed! Hope everyone is happy an healthy during this covid19 pandemic, if anything it's given my time to research an provide you with a much needed update to Ark Shark!

In this release I've done the following!

+ Ark Settings Backup (so if a update or file check erases all your settings you can press one button in my application an restore it)
+ FOV can be defined in my application which can go waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay higher than the game allows, allowing you to see more. Also BACKUP YOUR SETTINGS!
+ Two more Ini's No FOG (ON any map) Enhanced an Illegal
+ More hotkeys, such as auto-run/fly (think cruise control) and a few others (Auto-Eat & Drinking).
+ A restore mode for people using the global font.

- Remove un-needed buttons from locations in my program that "User Defined Hotkeys" already do.
- Removed unwanted verbiage and global checkbox, it's controlled manually from the install now.

= Fix for application crashing with the error found in #ðŸ’¢known-issuesðŸ’¢
= Fixed Screenshot folder location (best I can)


4/17 Update

Hope everyone is happy an healthy during this covid19 pandemic, sorry I haven't been throwing out as many updates as I normally do. But I have been working on this project with my @Alpha Tester team! We have great news going forward with the next update.

+ Ark Settings Backup (so if a update or file check erases all your settings you can press one button in my application an restore it)
+ FOV can be defined in my application which can go waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay higher than the game allows, allowing you to see more.

As usual as soon as it's released the @Donators will get a knock at it first, an way in on changes/updates/add-ons, then the final release will come out to everyone else later on! If you haven't donated now's the time, I'd appreciate the support!

Working on a new ini's!

I have one now that removes fog on all maps WITH the new adjustment the dev's have done to the game. But it's working currently as a enhanced ini only. I'm working on combining it with some of the settings in the "new illegal" ini to see if I can make a new hybrid!

Stay tuned!



Side note, the big reason why my releases have been running late is because I found a awesome un-official server to play on. It's owned by a good friend of mine an it's the full Ark Cluster with beyond awesome rates, they make Ark even more addicting. If you want a break from officials for any reason, check out his cluster! It's PvP AND PvE locked cluster! Heads up I'm admin over there as well! <3

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************
***** FOR THOSE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE INI's PLEASE VISIT MY DISCORD AND VOTE! I'm focusing my effort to fix the ones having the most problems first! *****
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

It's done! If you have auto-update on you already have it but v0.2000 is here!

What's New?
-Added Global Font Installer (Donators Only)
-Added Start the game with Global Installer using my program for those who are lazy, and don't want to figure out configuring Ark to work with Global Installer.
-Added Auto-Ini Snow Owl & Tek Gear Fix - When enabled will work with ANY INI you choose. BEAWARE THOUGH it may change some the visuals your used to with a certain ini.
-Added Auto Check for New Ark Shark Programs through the program.

What's fixed?
-Fixed Centered Cross Hair in-game. (This isn't ready yet. But does work. Click the "Toggle Cross Hair" button using F10 to turn it off and F11 to adjust what it looks like an color. ALSO it works with any game!
-Fixed Hard Drive Calculations. Thanks for the pre-alpha tester Vorkoz for the support on seeing this break.
-Fixed Direct Connect erroring out because of a VAR change. Thanks for the pre-alpha tester Vorkoz for the support on seeing this break.
-Fixed Dark Mode not working for new users because of needed files.
-Fixed Some missed lines of stupid code slowing things down.

Listen please read below. LIKE READ THIS. I MEAN YOU. YOU READ THIS DON'T IGNORE THIS!!!!!!!!
-You need to re-find you ini before using this program to do a internal format variable change. To do this simply go to the "System Config" tab and select the "Change your source Locations" button. Feel free to use the Auto-Find to make this go much faster.

Update: 80% done with Global Font Auto-Installer. To make the Friday release I'll release the next version once I'm not with the portion. The next update after that will be the adjustment of the POV.

Update: So I got home a verified with two accounts, as of right now, nothing is happening with enforcement or changes to the ini. So business as usual. Nothing will need to change with my program! Which personally for me means less coding which means I can get you this next release to you soon! Can't wait!

Update: The below seems to be intermittent with some people not having any issues at all with the program. I'm prolly still going to make the adjustment but many if any may not need it.

Update: I've now gotten multiple reports that "currently" anyone trying to load the game with the latest update, Ark is reverting the ini code back to default. It's been tested with my application an it looks as if some minor tweaking on my side I can get the ini working again with the newer maps as well. Basically having my program change the ini after game load instead of before. This shouldn't be a issue.

I want to repeat, working with the ini with game like this, twists like this will always happen, be careful using this program. As again it operates currently in a "grey" area that can be changed. It hasn't been touched or changed in forever. An with as many people who use my program or manually do it themselves a "mass ban" like that simply doesn't seem possible or worth it. With as many third party applications using it for non-officials it would be crazy if they did anything further.

Going forward, my next update will release sometime Friday with even more updates and the new timing fix for what has been put in place. So hang tight I'll keep everyone updated on anything I hear along the way! Thank you again!

Next release lots more fixes, adding auto-ini adjustment. Will allow you to apply the tek helm/snow owl fix to ANY INI you've chosen, and fix it on the fly if you want!

This is still a WIP. Donators will get it first for the first week it is becomes available! It will be available free to everyone else after! :)

Will be adding a second area, for customizable ini as well, by choosing what you want to see, the program will create it on the fly! :heart: That's later though, but it's in the works! Stay tuned!
