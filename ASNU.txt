Hello everyone Im sorry Ive been MIA for a while now, Iâ€™ve had a lot of IRL stuff going on. For everyone in the US Happy Thanksgiving! With this horrible COVID19 year coming to an end I hope everyone is staying safe! With plenty of bugs fixes and enhancements coming to this project, I want to advise I will be working with another dev soon! 

Combining forces with @Olivier project creator of Ark-Automated! Found here! https://github.com/ark-automated/Ark-Automated I think his design will fit my project much better. Hoping Ill learn a lot in the process. If you want to learn more about his project visit his discord here https://discord.gg/3uhQp7R 

As this month will be slow to get going, in December I have a lot of time off and will be refocusing my efforts to re-build this application. I hoping to have a better platform to rate inis, define a create custom iniâ€™s to share via my generator as well, pull your favorite Ark players iniâ€™s from a catalog.

Ill keep you posted on the progress and hopefully will have a working prototype soon! Thanks for everyone support on my project over the years! I love this community and everyone in it!

Note If youve already donated, as per protocol you will be getting updates first! As well no further donation will be needed!

V.3000 Release!
Wow where to begin, this took me 3 solid days to convert to a multi-client support! Your friends or friends of a friends who are using EPIC now can take advantage of my Ini Program now!

What you need to know.

Added Multiple Fixes Area to tell what fixes you're running.
Fix Dedicated Storage Boxes on any Ini
Set FPS on any Ini on the fly!
Two more hot fixes. (Careful running them all, there a known issue currently I'm trying to work out.)
4 MORE INI's!
New NO FOG Default Illegal Plus Ini
Enhanced NO FOG Plus REMOVE ALL Ini
Enhanced NO FOG Plus Ini
New Illegal Remove All NO FOG Ini
Multi-Client Support ( You specify a client now, you can't run both at the same time with my program.)
Steam
EPIC
Moved Menu's around
Add FOV for both clients

Known Issues

DO NOT USE ALL THREE FIXES at the same time, or if you do definitely not on huge ini's there's a parsing problem I'm still trying to work out.

6/16/2020
Well, I was going to release the next version tomorrow. But it's going to have to wait a couple of days. I'm now adding on top of the FOV change and the TWO more ini's I specified in #ðŸŽ¡upcoming-featuresðŸŽ¢ and #âš¡what-it-can-do multi-client support.

Thanks to @Wingman he tested an at least for now using the manual method with the Epic account still works with the Ini change. Thus I'm adding it to my installer/finder for the ini to look for the local Epic directory.

For those who don't want to wait look in the ?\Epic Games\ARKSurvivalEvolved\Engine\Config folder. The question mark being where ever your Epic Ark game is installed too. Thanks for the continued support, I'll try to get this new update out fast.

Of course those who are @Donators will get it first, I will then release the public release soon after!

5/30/2020
If you get time please check for this. Can't hurt an it's very easy to do. I want to make sure everyone is safe. Thanks @Vorkoz for the heads up on this.

Discord Client Reveals Trojan Malware - Here is How To Check Yourself Before You Protect Yourself

https://wccftech.com/discord-anarchygrabber-malware-check-removal/

The TL;DR is by navigating to:

%AppData%\Discord\[version]\modules\discord_desktop_core\index.js

and opening it with Notepad, you can check and see if there have been any modifications to the file. A clean index.js file will only feature a single line of code as shown below:

module.exports = require('./core.asar');


On a side note: still trucking along on the newest ini's coming soon TWO MORE! Then soon after the Ini custom creator. I've been requested by a donator as well to add a user defined FPS count that will modify your ini to that custom setting. So that will be added soon as well!

Stay tuned!

5/11/2020

Update! 5/6

Version 0.2600 has landed! Hope everyone is happy an healthy during this covid19 pandemic, if anything it's given my time to research an provide you with a much needed update to Ark Shark!

In this release I've done the following!

+ Ark Settings Backup (so if a update or file check erases all your settings you can press one button in my application an restore it)
+ FOV can be defined in my application which can go waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay higher than the game allows, allowing you to see more. Also BACKUP YOUR SETTINGS!
+ Two more Ini's No FOG (ON any map) Enhanced an Illegal
+ More hotkeys, such as auto-run/fly (think cruise control) and a few others (Auto-Eat & Drinking).
+ A restore mode for people using the global font.

- Remove un-needed buttons from locations in my program that "User Defined Hotkeys" already do.
- Removed unwanted verbiage and global checkbox, it's controlled manually from the install now.

= Fix for application crashing with the error found in #ðŸ’¢known-issuesðŸ’¢
= Fixed Screenshot folder location (best I can)

As usual as soon as it's released the @Donators will get a knock at it first, an way in on changes/updates/add-ons, then the final release will come out to everyone else later on! If you haven't donated now's the time, I'd appreciate the support!

Working on a new ini's!

I have one now that removes fog on all maps WITH the new adjustment the dev's have done to the game. But it's working currently as a enhanced ini only. I'm working on combining it with some of the settings in the "new illegal" ini to see if I can make a new hybrid!

Stay tuned!

Hot of the press! v0.2200 release!

-Added new Ini "New Illegal Ini"
-Added all the hotkeys requested (11+), more to come!
-Added STOP Auto-Starting the game toggle. (User Requested)

-Fixed issues with user defined hotkeys
-Fixed Slider issue
-Fixed the application Auto-Update (Now always updating to latest version, not version by version.)
-Fixed Snow Owl Healing "Wrong Auto-Click xD"

Still working on a solid ini to replace the illegal having issues. Some ini just are not designed for Genesis so be aware of that.

-Added a program stop requested by a donator. It stops the auto-start of Ark when you switch Ini's. BE VERY CAREFUL with this.

-Fixed the hot key system! This will be rolling out soon!
-Fixed auto-update to pull latest program. (Currently you have to go version by version.)

More coming soon! Hoping next release will be done by tomorrow! Stay tuned!

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************
***** FOR THOSE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE INI's PLEASE VISIT MY DISCORD AND VOTE! I'm focusing my effort to fix the ones having the most problems first! *****
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

It's done! If you have auto-update on you already have it but v0.2000 is here!

What's New?
-Added Global Font Installer (Donators Only)
-Added Start the game with Global Installer using my program for those who are lazy, and don't want to figure out configuring Ark to work with Global Installer.
-Added Auto-Ini Snow Owl & Tek Gear Fix - When enabled will work with ANY INI you choose. BEAWARE THOUGH it may change some the visuals your used to with a certain ini.
-Added Auto Check for New Ark Shark Programs through the program.

What's fixed?
-Fixed Centered Cross Hair in-game. (This isn't ready yet. But does work. Click the "Toggle Cross Hair" button using F10 to turn it off and F11 to adjust what it looks like an color. ALSO it works with any game!
-Fixed Hard Drive Calculations. Thanks for the pre-alpha tester Vorkoz for the support on seeing this break.
-Fixed Direct Connect erroring out because of a VAR change. Thanks for the pre-alpha tester Vorkoz for the support on seeing this break.
-Fixed Dark Mode not working for new users because of needed files.
-Fixed Some missed lines of stupid code slowing things down.

Listen please read below. LIKE READ THIS. I MEAN YOU. YOU READ THIS DON'T IGNORE THIS!!!!!!!!
-You need to re-find you ini before using this program to do a internal format variable change. To do this simply go to the "System Config" tab and select the "Change your source Locations" button. Feel free to use the Auto-Find to make this go much faster.

Update: 80% done with Global Font Auto-Installer. To make the Friday release I'll release the next version once I'm not with the portion. The next update after that will be the adjustment of the POV.

Update: So I got home a verified with two accounts, as of right now, nothing is happening with enforcement or changes to the ini. So business as usual. Nothing will need to change with my program! Which personally for me means less coding which means I can get you this next release to you soon! Can't wait!

Update: The below seems to be intermittent with some people not having any issues at all with the program. I'm prolly still going to make the adjustment but many if any may not need it.

Update: I've now gotten multiple reports that "currently" anyone trying to load the game with the latest update, Ark is reverting the ini code back to default. It's been tested with my application an it looks as if some minor tweaking on my side I can get the ini working again with the newer maps as well. Basically having my program change the ini after game load instead of before. This shouldn't be a issue.

I want to repeat, working with the ini with game like this, twists like this will always happen, be careful using this program. As again it operates currently in a "grey" area that can be changed. It hasn't been touched or changed in forever. An with as many people who use my program or manually do it themselves a "mass ban" like that simply doesn't seem possible or worth it. With as many third party applications using it for non-officials it would be crazy if they did anything further.

Going forward, my next update will release sometime Friday with even more updates and the new timing fix for what has been put in place. So hang tight I'll keep everyone updated on anything I hear along the way! Thank you again!

Next release lots more fixes, adding auto-ini adjustment. Will allow you to apply the tek helm/snow owl fix to ANY INI you've chosen, and fix it on the fly if you want!

This is still a WIP. Donators will get it first for the first week it is becomes available! It will be available free to everyone else after! :)

Will be adding a second area, for customizable ini as well, by choosing what you want to see, the program will create it on the fly! :heart: That's later though, but it's in the works! Stay tuned!

v0.1700

Basically read below for updates on this release. I added a few fixes that were needed.

-Fixed Hotkey that do not work. (More will be coming, it's just the clicker currently.)
